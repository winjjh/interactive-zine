        <div class="text1">
          The Korean alphabet, known as Hangul (Hangeul)[note 1] in South Korea
          and Chosŏn'gŭl in North Korea, is a writing system for the Korean
          language created by King Sejong the Great in 1443.[2][3] The letters
          for the five basic consonants reflect the shape of the speech organs
          used to pronounce them, and they are systematically modified to
          indicate phonetic features; similarly, the vowel letters are
          systematically modified for related sounds, making Hangul a featural
          writing system.
        </div>
        <div class="text2">
          Modern Hangul orthography uses 24 basic letters: 14 consonant letters
          (ㄱ ㄴ ㄷ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅅ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ) and 10 vowel letters (ㅏ
          ㅑ ㅓ ㅕ ㅗ ㅛ ㅜ ㅠ ㅡ ㅣ). There are also 27 complex letters formed
          by combining the basic letters: 5 tense consonant letters (ㄲ ㄸ ㅃ ㅆ
          ㅉ), 11 complex consonant letters (ㄳ ㄵ ㄶ ㄺ ㄻ ㄼ ㄽ ㄾ ㄿ ㅀ ㅄ)
          and 11 complex vowel letters (ㅐ ㅒ ㅔ ㅖ ㅘ ㅙ ㅚ ㅝ ㅞ ㅟ ㅢ). Four
          basic letters in the original alphabet are no longer used: 1 vowel
          letter (ㆍ) and 3 consonant letters (ㅿ ㆁ ㆆ)
        </div>
        <div class="text3">
          The Korean letters are written in syllabic blocks with the alphabetic
          letters arranged in two dimensions. For example, Hangeul in Korean is
          spelled 한글, not ㅎㅏㄴㄱㅡㄹ. These syllables begin with a consonant
          letter, then a vowel letter, and then potentially another consonant
          letter. If the syllable begins with a vowel sound, then the consonant
          "ㅇ" will act as a silent placeholder. Syllables may begin with basic
          or tense consonants, but not complex ones. The vowel can be basic or
          complex, while the second consonant can be basic, complex or a limited
          number of tense consonants. The way the syllable is structured depends
          on if the vowel is a "tall" vowel (vertical base line) or a "fat"
          vowel (horizontal base line); if the vowel is "tall" then the first
          consonant and vowel are written above the second consonant (if there
          is one), whereas if a vowel is "fat" then all of the components are
          written individually top to bottom.
        </div>
        <div class="text4">
          As it combines the features of alphabetic and syllabic writing
          systems, it has been described as an "alphabetic syllabary". As
          in traditional Chinese and Japanese writing, Korean texts were
          traditionally written top to bottom, right to left, and are
          occasionally still written this way for stylistic purposes. Today, it
          is typically written from left to right with spaces between words and
          western-style punctuation. It is the official writing system of
          Korea, including both North and South Korea. It is a co-official
          writing system in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and
          Changbai Korean Autonomous County in Jilin Province, China. It is also
          sometimes used to write the Cia-Cia language spoken near the town of
          Baubau, Indonesia. The Taiwanese linguist Hsu Tsao-te [zh] developed
          and used a modified Hangul alphabet to represent spoken Taiwanese
          Hokkien and was later supported by Ang Ui-jin (see Taiwanese
          Hangul).
